opengl_redbook
==============

Samples of the openGL redbook(&lt;OpenGL Programming Guide>). These samples can be run in Linux. 

Many code comes from redbook, so the copyright of the code belongs to the original author and me. 
Any other guys use it in any way are NOT allowed, especially for business purpose.
